	I work as an MSR student in the Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Delhi and working in the field of soft and rehabilitation robotics.
	Prior to this, I graduated with a BTech degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 from NIT Durgapur. My master's thesis involves the development of a textile wearable actuator for elbow flexion. I will work on the CAD design, Finite Element Analysis and further developing a mathematical model for force-torque estimation of the bending actuator. Thereafter I plan on using Machine Learning/Deep Learning methods to further optimise my design for maximising efficiency.
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: lavender; text-align: justify;">
	During my period of study, I had developed a keen interest in Computer Aided Design, Automation, Robotics and Mechatronics. In order to pursue my area of interests, and to further dive into it, I underwent my Summer Internship (2015-2016) under Dr. Atul Thakur of IIT Patna.
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: lavender; text-align: justify;">
	I took to working in the field of Soft Robotics since I believe it to be the future of robots including wearable robotics to assist and augment human mobility. I was actively involved in two Soft Robotic Rehabilitation projects, one of which involves Development & Fabrication of a new Soft Actuator to serve Physiotherapy purposes for people suffering from Hemiparesis using a silicone rubber based 1-DOF bending actuator. I did my summer internship for the 2017-2018 session in IIT Guwahati on Soft Robots, details of which are available in my CV. All this research work lead to two conference publications, under the able guidance of Mr. Aman Arora of CMERI, Durgapur, which have been listed below in the 'Publications' section.

	<p style="background-color: lavender; text-align: justify;">	
	I worked for PwC India as a Technology Consultant, under the competency Enterprise Apps : Microsoft.
	As a Technology Consultant, belonging to the Microsoft Enterprise competency, I was working on the development of a Web Application, for one of the leading banking entities in India, Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited. I was responsible for developing the backend of the application using C# and ASP .NET Web API framework. I was also responsible for database management, and developing Stored Procedures using Sql Server and Sql Server Management Studio( SSMS)
