		Debjit Hore- A Brief Introduction.
	</h1>
	<p style="background-color: beige; text-align: justify;">
	I joined as an MSR student in IIT Delhi in the Department of Applied Mechanics and working to enhance my knowledge in the field of soft and rehabilitation robotics.
	Prior to this, I graduated with a BTech degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 from NIT Durgapur.

	<p style="background-color: beige; text-align: justify;">
	During my period of study, I had developed a keen interest in Computer Aided Design, Automation, Robotics and Mechatronics. In order to pursue my area of interests, and to further dive into it, I underwent my Summer Internship (2015-2016) under Dr. Atul Thakur of IIT Patna.

	Henceforth, I have turned to Soft Robotics, since I clearly believe it's the future of Robotics. Currently, I was actively involved in two Soft Robotic Rehabilitation projects, one of which involves Development & Fabrication of a new Soft Actuator to serve Physiotherapy purposes for people suffering from Hemiparesis. I did my summer internship for the 2017-2018 session in IIT Guwahati on Soft Robots, details of which are available in my CV. All this research work lead to 2 conference publications, under the able guidance of Mr. Aman Arora of CMERI, Durgapur :

	I worked for PwC India as a Technology Consultant, under the competency Enterprise Apps : Microsoft.
	As a Technology Consultant, belonging to the Microsoft Enterprise competency, I was working on the development of a Web Application, for one of the leading banking entities in India, Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited. I was responsible for developing the backend of the application using C# and ASP .NET Web API framework. I was also responsible for database management, and developing Stored Procedures using Sql Server and Sql Server Management Studio( SSMS)
