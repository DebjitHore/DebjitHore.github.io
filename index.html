	I work as a Mechanical Engineer Grade II for the Offshore Projects Group (OPG) of Houston and Asia Pacific Region of Oceaneering International. I use my expertise in the field of Concept Design, Industry Standards, and Finite Element Analysis to come up with solutions to problems encountered by the Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) team during execution projects offshore.
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: lavender; text-align: justify;">
	I completeted my MS(R) from the Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Delhi and worked in the field of soft and rehabilitation robotics.
	Prior to this, I graduated with a BTech degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 from NIT Durgapur. My master's thesis involved the development of a textile wearable actuator for elbow flexion. I worked on the design concept, Finite Element Analysis and further developed a mathematical model for force-torque estimation of the bending actuator. A prototype was also fabricated and tested to benchmark the actuator characteristics. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and signal processing was used to pinpoint the reduction in muscle activation that was achieved from the actuator coupling.

	I worked for PwC India as a Technology Consultant, under the competency Enterprise Apps : Microsoft.
	As a Technology Consultant, belonging to the Microsoft Enterprise competency, I was working on the development of a Web Application, for one of the leading banking entities in India. I was responsible for developing the backend of the application using C# and ASP .NET Web API framework. I was also responsible for database management, and developing Stored Procedures using Sql Server and Sql Server Management Studio( SSMS)
